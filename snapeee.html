      <div class="content">
      <p>I was a 4th employee at Snapeee and helped the startup to lead a-million-users product with a growth team.
        First of all, I was responsible for creating our own persona and actively went out within the online community to connect with potential customers and advocate the brand.<br><br>
        As the service grew up, the company was facing a big change in branding and re-targeting its users and customers to monetize.
        I updated their user persona and colour palette for a more modern, adultlike feel and changed their typography to better suit their brand nature.</p>

        <div class="content">
      <p>After setting the goal for branding with the team, I speedly moved to advertising project and worked with sales team to provide an in-app-advertising to clients such as Fasion, media cosmetics companies to promote their products and brands.<br><br>
      With an amazing team, I was able to create advertisings in several screens on the app without not letting user feel uncomfortable and less-actively. I also created the ads system and its flow for a engineer team so that both of sales team and creative team can make sure we are on the same page for monetizing and geering up Snapeee app.</p>
